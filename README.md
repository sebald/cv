# CV

What started as an evening activity to try out some libraries ended up me creating my CV with web technologies. While this might be a bit over-engineered, the web is still one of the better layouting technolgies.

## Under investigation

- [parceljs](https://parceljs.org/)
- [styled-components](styled-components.com)
- [React's new context API](https://medium.com/dailyjs/reacts-%EF%B8%8F-new-context-api-70c9fe01596b)

## "Features"

- "No-config"â„¢ project setup (`parcel-bundler`, `jest`, `prettier`, `tslint`)
- Use `styled-components` for theming, mixins and to create a design system
